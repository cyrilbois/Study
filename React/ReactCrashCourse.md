# Introduction

React runs on the client as a SPA (Single Page Application), but it can be used to build full stack apps by communicating with a server/API (eg. MERN Stack with Express/Node, or Laravel API, Django API, etc.)

React is often referred to as a front-end "framework" because it is capable and directly comparable to a framework such as Angular or Vue.
